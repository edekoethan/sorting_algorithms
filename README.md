In C, sorting algorithms are used to arrange elements in a specific order, usually in ascending or descending order. Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science and is widely used in various applications. Different sorting algorithms have different time complexities, which determine how efficiently they can sort a list of elements. The time complexity is usually expressed using Big O notation, which describes the upper bound of the algorithm's time complexity as the input size grows.

Here is a summary of some common sorting algorithms and their time complexities in the best, average, and worst cases:

Bubble Sort:

Best Case: O(n)
Average Case: O(n^2)
Worst Case: O(n^2)
Selection Sort:

Best Case: O(n^2)
Average Case: O(n^2)
Worst Case: O(n^2)
Insertion Sort:

Best Case: O(n)
Average Case: O(n^2)
Worst Case: O(n^2)
Merge Sort:

Best Case: O(n log n)
Average Case: O(n log n)
Worst Case: O(n log n)
Quick Sort:

Best Case: O(n log n)
Average Case: O(n log n)
Worst Case: O(n^2)
Heap Sort:

Best Case: O(n log n)
Average Case: O(n log n)
Worst Case: O(n log n)
The choice of which sorting algorithm to use depends on the specific requirements of the task and the size of the input data. Some algorithms, like Merge Sort and Quick Sort, are more efficient for larger datasets, while others like Insertion Sort and Bubble Sort may be suitable for smaller datasets or already partially sorted data. Understanding the time complexity of sorting algorithms is crucial in selecting the right algorithm for a given scenario.
